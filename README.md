# Celero-Conan


[Conan](https://bintray.com/ppodsiadly/conan/celero%3Appodsiadly) package for Celero library.


## Basic setup

    $ conan install celero/2.4.0@ppodsiadly/stable
    
## Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a `conanfile.txt`:
    
    [requires]
    celero/2.4.0@ppodsiadly/stable

    [options]
    celero:shared=True # or False, default is True
    
    [generators]
    cmake

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    conan install . 

Project setup installs the library (and all his dependencies) and generates the files `conanbuildinfo.cmake` with all the paths and variables that you need to link with your dependencies.
